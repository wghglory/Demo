            Adobe today announced a major update to Lightroom CC (and the launch of the standalone
            Lightroom 6), its professional photo editing software for Mac users. The new update
            brings significant performance improvements and several new features like HDR merge,
            Panorama merge, facial recognition, improved slideshows, a filter brush, and more.
            One of the most impressive new organizational features in the updated version of
            Lightroom is facial recognition, which lets Lightroom users organize their photos
            by subject for the first time, in addition to organizing with tags, flags, and star
            ratings. Once a face in a single photo is named, the software is able to find more
            images that feature that person for quick tagging by face. A new "People" view lets
            users sort photos by person.

            Panorama Merge, another new feature, lets photographers stitch together multiple
            images, including RAW and JPG files to create ultra high-quality panoramic shots.
            It has built in tools for automatically cropping non-matching edges and changing
            perspectives. With Lightroom's graphical performance improvements, even huge panorama
            files can be edited in real time with little lag. adobepanoramamerge With HDR Merge,
            it's possible to combine several different photos with different exposure settings
            into a single HDR image. Unlike other photo editing apps, Adobe's HDR Merge works
            directly with both JPG and RAW images. Because it works with RAW files, a high-quality
            HDR image can be created from as few as two photos. Other HDR options typically
            require more photos at different exposure levels to create a suitable image.

            Lightroom's new filter brush, a popular request from Adobe customers, works with
            graduated and radial filter affects, letting a filter mask be reshaped with a brush
            tool so filter effects can be added and subtracted from specific parts of images
            for better precision. The last major feature update, which adds advanced slideshow
            tools, lets users put pan and zoom effects into their slideshows to add a motion
            effect. There's also a tool for syncing slideshows to multiple audio clips, and
            it's possible to add up to 10 songs to a slideshow. Today's update to Lightroom
            CC may be of particular interest to Mac users who previously used the now-defunct
            Aperture photo editing software, as Apple no longer offers a professional-level
            photo editing app since discontinuing Aperture in favor of Photos for OS X. Lightroom
            has many professional-level features that are missing from the Photos for OS X app,
            and it also offers the same cross-platform syncing of all images with a Creative
            Cloud subscription. Adobe has promised to continue adding new features and more
            advanced tools to Lightroom in the future. Adobe is also updating its Lightroom
            apps for the iPad and the iPhone, which connect to Lightroom CC and allow for photos
            and edits to be synced between all devices using Adobe's cloud service. The apps
            are gaining features like improved cropping tools, with the updated versions available
            for download today. Lightroom CC is available through Adobe's Creative Cloud Photography
            plan, which bundles Photoshop and Lightroom together for $9.99 per month, or through
            Adobe's complete Creative Cloud plan, featuring all Adobe software for $49.99 per
            month. Adobe is also selling the new Lightroom update on a standalone basis, branded
            as Lightroom 6 and priced at $149 (or $79 upgrade pricing). The standalone version
            of Lightroom does not include cloud integration with Adobe's mobile Lightroom apps
            and Lightroom on the web.
