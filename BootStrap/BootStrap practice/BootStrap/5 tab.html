                    Adobe today announced a major update to Lightroom CC (and the launch of the standalone
                    Lightroom 6), its professional photo editing software for Mac users. The new update
                    brings significant performance improvements and several new features like HDR merge,
                    Panorama merge, facial recognition, improved slideshows, a filter brush, and more.
                    One of the most impressive new organizational features in the updated version of
                    Lightroom is facial recognition, which lets Lightroom users organize their photos
                    by subject for the first time, in addition to organizing with tags, flags, and star
                    ratings. Once a face in a single photo is named, the software is able to find more
                    images that feature that person for quick tagging by face. A new "People" view lets
                    users sort photos by person.

                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
                    Panorama Merge, another new feature, lets photographers stitch together multiple
                    images, including RAW and JPG files to create ultra high-quality panoramic shots.
                    It has built in tools for automatically cropping non-matching edges and changing
                    perspectives. With Lightroom's graphical performance improvements, even huge panorama
                    files can be edited in real time with little lag.

                    With HDR Merge, it's possible to combine several different photos with different
                    exposure settings into a single HDR image. Unlike other photo editing apps, Adobe's
                    HDR Merge works directly with both JPG and RAW images. Because it works with RAW
                    files, a high-quality HDR image can be created from as few as two photos. Other
                    HDR options typically require more photos at different exposure levels to create
                    a suitable image.

                    Lightroom's new filter brush, a popular request from Adobe customers, works with
                    graduated and radial filter affects, letting a filter mask be reshaped with a brush
                    tool so filter effects can be added and subtracted from specific parts of images
                    for better precision. The last major feature update, which adds advanced slideshow
                    tools, lets users put pan and zoom effects into their slideshows to add a motion
                    effect. There's also a tool for syncing slideshows to multiple audio clips, and
                    it's possible to add up to 10 songs to a slideshow.
