                Adobe today announced a major update to Lightroom CC (and the launch of the standalone
                Lightroom 6), its professional photo editing software for Mac users. The new update
                brings significant performance improvements and several new features like HDR merge,
                Panorama merge, facial recognition, improved slideshows, a filter brush, and more.
                One of the most impressive new organizational features in the updated version of
                Lightroom is facial recognition, which lets Lightroom users organize their photos
                by subject for the first time, in addition to organizing with tags, flags, and star
                ratings. Once a face in a single photo is named, the software is able to find more
                images that feature that person for quick tagging by face. A new "People" view lets
                users sort photos by person.

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="profile">
                Panorama Merge, another new feature, lets photographers stitch together multiple
                images, including RAW and JPG files to create ultra high-quality panoramic shots.
                It has built in tools for automatically cropping non-matching edges and changing
                perspectives. With Lightroom's graphical performance improvements, even huge panorama
                files can be edited in real time with little lag.

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="messages">
                With HDR Merge, it's possible to combine several different photos with different
                exposure settings into a single HDR image. Unlike other photo editing apps, Adobe's
                HDR Merge works directly with both JPG and RAW images. Because it works with RAW
                files, a high-quality HDR image can be created from as few as two photos. Other
                HDR options typically require more photos at different exposure levels to create
                a suitable image.

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="settings">
                Lightroom's new filter brush, a popular request from Adobe customers, works with
                graduated and radial filter affects, letting a filter mask be reshaped with a brush
                tool so filter effects can be added and subtracted from specific parts of images
                for better precision. The last major feature update, which adds advanced slideshow
                tools, lets users put pan and zoom effects into their slideshows to add a motion
                effect. There's also a tool for syncing slideshows to multiple audio clips, and
                it's possible to add up to 10 songs to a slideshow.

                Monday April 20, 2015 11:27 AM PDT by Juli Clover YouTube today announced changes
                to its YouTube Data API, causing many older apps on various devices to stop functioning.
                On the second-generation Apple TV or older, the YouTube channel will no longer be
                accessible, and on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, iOS 7 or later is required
                for the YouTube app to function.

            <div class="tab-pane" id="drop2">
                Second-generation Apple TV users will have no way to watch YouTube videos on their
                devices after today, but iOS device owners with versions of iOS older than iOS 7
                can use mobile YouTube in Safari to watch videos. YouTube is sharing the news via
                a discontinuation video that's being shared on all older devices.
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="drop3">
                If your device supports iOS 7 or above, you can download the YouTube app from the
                App Store. If not, visit m.youtube.com in your mobile browser to access YouTube.
